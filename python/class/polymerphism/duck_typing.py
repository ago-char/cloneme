# if there is a bird who looks like duck, swims like duck, walk like a duck. This must be a duck lol. The similar concept is the main mantra of duckTyping
# duck typing is actually the concept of polymerphism i.e an object can call 'foo' method, if it has that feature within. Suppose to call count method, you need not necessarily be 'string'

a = "Hari"
# count method for type str
print(a.count("a"))
print(a)

a = ["Hari", "shyam", "22", 22, "Rita", "Hari", "singham"]
# count method for type list
a.count("a")
