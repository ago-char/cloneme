Build the table structure like up using html. Don't describe just code.

wrong: it results above one, not which i mentioned.

let me explain.
The table has total 3 rows but cols per row vary. 
First row has 2 columns, as 1st col takes 3 unit space & 2nd col takes 1 unit space.
Second row has 3 columns, as 1st col takes 2 unit space, 2nd & 3rd col take 1 unit space each.
Third row has 3 columns, as 1st col takes 1 unit space, 2nd col takes 2 unit space & 3rd col takes 1 unit space.
